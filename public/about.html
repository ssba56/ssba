<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hello, I'm Serra Baycar. I am a software engineer and digital game developer. This website is a platform where I showcase the software projects I've worked on, as well as my game development journey and the work I've created with my passion for technology.

  In my software development journey, I aim to not only apply technical knowledge but also leverage my creativity and problem-solving skills to produce unique and effective solutions. Game development is not just a profession for me; it's also a passion. From the storytelling power of games to the ways we create interactive experiences, I find motivation in exploring a wide range of projects.
  
  This site offers you the chance to explore the software projects I've developed, learn more about upcoming projects, and engage with my thoughts on the future of technology. If you're interested in game development or software projects, you're in the right place!</p>
